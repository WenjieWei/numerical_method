This is the testing file.
The circuit files are organized in the following way:

<Numbering of the current circuit>
<number of branches>
<number of nodes>
<B1>
<B2>
...
<BB>

The branches are organized as such:
<Branch ID>,<Start node ID>,<End node ID>,<J>,<R>,<E>

Branch ID should be in range of [0, B-1],
Node ID should be in range of [0, N-1].
