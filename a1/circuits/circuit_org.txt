This is the testing file.
The circuit files are organized in the following way:

Name,<Numbering of the current circuit>,B,<# of branches>,N,<# of nodes>

<Branch ID>,<Start node ID>,<End node ID>,<J>,<R>,<E>
<Branch ID>,<Start node ID>,<End node ID>,<J>,<R>,<E>
<Branch ID>,<Start node ID>,<End node ID>,<J>,<R>,<E>
<Branch ID>,<Start node ID>,<End node ID>,<J>,<R>,<E>
...

Branch ID should be in range of [0, B-1],
Node ID should be in range of [0, N-1].
